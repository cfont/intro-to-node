# intro-to-node
This project will follow my training through several resources on Node.js

I am reading a couple of books and watching a few video courses on Node.js so this project will include things I learn from all of those resources. There may be branches associated with the different training resources but there will always be comments that reference where I learned whatever is being applied in those files.
